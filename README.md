Semplice Live Firstuse
======================

semplice-live-firstuse is a simple language selector for Semplice Live.

Role
----

This is the simple interface that asks the language to the user, before
loading the rest of Vera.

Upcoming changes
----------------

When Keeptalking will switch to python3, this application will follow.  
Also, it's planned to rely on systemd (alongside the 'manual' way) to set
keyboard, locale and timezone.  
This will save us the need to restart the display manager to apply the
changes.
